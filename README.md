   ```javascript
   copy(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(localStorage.opportunities), null, 2))
   ```

   ```
5. Paste into text files for safekeeping

2. Run:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('opportunities', 'YOUR_BACKUP_JSON')
   localStorage.setItem('companies', 'YOUR_COMPANIES_JSON')
   ```
3. Refresh the page

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Executable Won't Start
- **Check Windows SmartScreen**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- **Verify web folder**: Ensure `web` folder is next to `Notifyy.exe`
- **Port conflict**: Close apps using port 8000 or let Notifyy find next available port

### Notifications Not Working
1. Click "Enable Notifications" button in the app
2. Check Windows notification settings (Settings → System → Notifications)
3. Ensure browser has notification permissions

### Control Panel Won't Close
- If "Keep Window Open" is enabled, disable it first
- Then click Exit button or close the window

### Data Lost After Browser Clear
- Browser data clearing will remove all opportunities
- Always backup data before clearing browser cache/storage
- Consider using separate browser profile for Notifyy

### App Not in Startup
1. Open Control Panel
2. Check "Start automatically at login"
3. If still not working, check Windows Task Manager → Startup tab
